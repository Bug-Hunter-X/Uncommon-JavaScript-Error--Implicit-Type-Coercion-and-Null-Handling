# Uncommon JavaScript Error: Implicit Type Coercion and Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle JavaScript bug related to implicit type coercion and the handling of null values. The original code lacks robust error handling and type checking, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The improved solution addresses these issues using explicit type checking and error handling.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is intended to add 1 to a number.  However, it fails to explicitly handle non-number inputs (resulting in type coercion issues) and `null` values. This could lead to unexpected results or runtime errors.

## Solution

The solution explicitly checks the type of input `x` before performing the addition, thereby avoiding implicit type coercion. It throws an error for non-number inputs, ensuring robustness. It also handles the null case specifically.
